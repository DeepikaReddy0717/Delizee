        We are 2nd year students from <strong>Koneru Lakshmaiah University (KLU)</strong>, working on this food delivery app project as part of our academic learning.
        <br /><br />
        If you have any questions about the project or want to know more about how it works, feel free to contact us.
        <br /><br />
        Since this is a student project, responses might not be immediate, but weâ€™ll try our best to reply.
