      <p>
        We are 2nd year students working on a full-stack food delivery app called <strong>Delize</strong> as part of our project.
        <br /><br />
        Our app allows users to order food online and get it delivered to their location.
        <br /><br />
        The project includes:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Customer Panel</strong> – to order food and track delivery</li>
          <li><strong>Restaurant Panel</strong> – to manage orders and update menus</li>
          <li><strong>Admin Panel</strong> – to control and monitor the system</li>
          <li><strong>Delivery Agent Panel</strong> – to handle and complete deliveries</li>
        </ul>
        We are learning full-stack development by building this system from scratch.
